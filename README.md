# Expo + React Native To-Do List App

This is a practice project for React Native to create mobile apps for both Android and iOS.  
It was a fun project since I had already been using React for the web -- React Native was fairly easy to pick up, with minor differences (`View` instead of `div` etc) 

## Technologies Used
I used [Expo](expo.dev) with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) to continually test on my mobile android device + my spare iOS device to confirm the app worked on both platforms.
